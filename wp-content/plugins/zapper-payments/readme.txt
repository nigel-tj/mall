== Frequently Asked Questions ==
= Can I use this addon before registering as a Zapper Merchant? =
You will first need to apply to be a Zapper Merchant [here](https://www.zapper.com/apply.php?s=4), before you can use this addon.
After filling out the above form, a Zapper representative will contact you to help you get set up as soon as possible.

= Is Zapper secure? =
Absolutely, all the customer's sensitive information is stored on their device and is never sent to the merchant. So even if your website gets compromised,
your customer's card details will not be vulnerable.
