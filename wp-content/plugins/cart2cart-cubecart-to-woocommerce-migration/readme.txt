== Frequently Asked Questions ==

We highly recommend not to delete any of your entries (products, customers, orders, etc.) at the Source Store after full migration is completed. Since if you later on decide to use our Recent Data Migration Service we can’t guarantee proper data transfer results.
 
= Can I transfer my metadata to WooCommerce? =
Cart2Cart supports metadata migration to WooCommerce. Online store owners can migrate their meta titles, keywords and descriptions from CubeCart to WooCommerce store, but they need additional WordPress plugin for it.
